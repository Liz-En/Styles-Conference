                    <h4>DESIGNING A CULTURE OF DESIGN</h4>
                    <p>Workplace culture doesn’t start with beanbags, foosball tables,
                       or a beer fridge, <br> and it doesn’t end with neckties, PCs, or 
                       big corporations. It’s the unwritten rules,<br> behavior, beliefs,
                       and the motivations that enable good work to get done, or it’s <br>
                       what stifles a workforce. For design to be most effective and
                       for designers to feel <br> valued, we need to work in a culture 
                       that embraces design and allows it to <br> succeed.</p>

                       <p>
                        In Aaron’s session he will explore how to recognize the traits
                         of organizations that *get* <br> design, both large and small. He 
                         will share what those teams, departments,<br> and companies have 
                         that others don’t, and more importantly, how to begin to <br> change
                          your own workplace’s culture. Once you’ve worked within a 
                          culture of <br> design it’s almost impossible to imagine yourself 
                          anywhere else.
                       </p>

                    <h4>LIGHTS! CAMERA! INTERACTION! DESIGN INSPIRATION FROM <br> FILMMAKERS</h4>
                    <p>Films succeed in evoking responses and engaging audiences only 
                        with a <br> combination of well-written narrative and effective 
                        storytelling technique. It’s the <br> filmmaker’s job to put this 
                        together. To do so they’ve developed processes, tools <br> and 
                        techniques that allow them to focus attention, emphasize information, <br> 
                        foreshadow and produce the many elements that together comprise 
                        a well-told <br> story.</p>

                       <p>
                        With this workshop, we’ll revisit the topic of using stories in 
                        design and expand on <br> the technical aspects used in film to 
                        communicate. We’ll look at some tools used in <br> film, such as 
                        cinematic patterns, beat sheets, and storyboards. We’ll consider 
                        why <br> they’re used and how we might look to them for inspiration.
                       </p>

                       <h4>ABOUT ADAM</h4>

                       <p>Adam Connor is a designer, illustrator and speaker passionate 
                        about collaboration, <br> communication, creativity and storytelling. 
                        As an Experience Design Director <br> with Mad*Pow, Adam combines 10+ 
                        years of experience in interaction and experience <br> design with a

                        effective and easy-to-use digital products and services. He

                    <h4>(YOU SHOULD BE) TESTING YOUR JAVASCRIPT</h4>
                    <p>
                        JavaScript applications frequently utilize battle-tested 
                        libraries like jQuery, <br> AngularJS, Backbone.js and more, but 
                        how can we be sure that our code is ready <br> for production? 
                        This talk will share tips on how writing tests can be written 
                        easily  <br> and quickly and how to remove buggy code through testing.

                    <h4>DEATH TO WIREFRAMES: LONG LIVE RAPID PROTOTYPING</h4>
                    <p>
                        Static wireframes are a drag on the whole design process.
                         Prototyping makes <br> things a little better by allowing you to 
                         stitch together static wireframes or mockups <br> while adding 
                         basic interactions. Rapid prototyping with HTML, CSS, and 
                         JavaScript <br> is even better and faster; it increases collaboration 
                         and improves the iteration <br> process. Kill your wireframes. Long 
                         live rapid prototyping.
